/*This function initializes the pins that are used in pwm, assigns them to their alternate functions,

 *and the pre scaler for the clock. The frequency will work fine for anything bellow 525000, but it is 
 *not guaranteed to work above that. The pre scaler divides into the stm boards own internal clock to 
 *get a clock speed for the timer. The pre scaler works good at 1, but it can take any multiple of two 
 *as its input. The function will return the period of the pwm which is used to calculate the duty cycle 
 *when setting the pwm for each pin. 
 *
 *When deciding on the prescaller, use lower numbers for when you need higher frequencies and use higher
 *numbers when you need lower frequencies.
