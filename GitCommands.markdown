# Basics of git

This has a few helpful commands for working on this project.

- *git pull* : This should be run everytime you start working on code as it gets the current code from the Github and copies it to your working directory. 

- *git add FOO* : This adds folders/files to the git project. Used whenever you create a new file. Note you do not need to add things like compiled binaries, or random test files unless they are useful or needed.

- *git commit -am "MESSAGE"* : This is used to commit your changes to the git repository. Change "MESSAGE" to a descriptive messge about what you changed. This also needs to be run after you add anything via "git add".

- *git push* : This pushes the code from your computer to the Github so everyone can see it. Just doing a "git commit" is not enough. 

- *git status* : This shows a lot of information about the current (local) git repository. It shows the modified files since last commit, added files, deleted files, and files not added to the git repository. 

This is a very basic tutorial which I will expand on later if needed.
