## Latest update 
In this new setup I have included all the necessary files to program the IOToggle program to teh stm32F4 Discovery board. 


How to get setup on Linux or Mac:
1. Download GCC-ARM for your system from here https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download
2. Setup the path on your computer to the location of the downloaded GCC-ARM
3. Clone this directory to your computer
4. cd into IOToggle and run make
5. Plug in your discovery board via the mini-usb connector and run make burn
6. Viola! Your Discovery board will now be running the simple IOToggle program.

## Tasks for the hardware programming team 

- [] write your own programs for the discovery board 
- [] enable serial communication from the discovery board
- [] talk to ATTinys 


## Who has our STM32F4 Boards 
- Eric Colter  
- Martin Tuskevicius  
- Luke McBee  
- Jack Cottom
